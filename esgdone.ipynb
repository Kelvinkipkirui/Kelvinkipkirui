This makes \\n\\n5G suitable for providing super-fast internet speeds in high \\n\\ndensity areas and for linking thousands of connected devices in \\n\\na manufacturing environment and supply chain management for \\n\\nbusinesses.\\n\\n“Our strong financial  \\nand ESG performance  \\nover the last year are the \\nresult of placing our customers \\nat the heart of our business \\npriorities.”\\n\\n5\\n\\nPARTNERING FOR GROWTH: TRANSFORMING LIVES   |   KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS\\x0cWe are confident that we have overcome the regulatory \\n\\nThat initial investment has continued to show rewards with M-PESA \\n\\nchallenges and consumer’s suspicions associated with 5G and we \\n\\nrevenue growing 30.3 % year-on-year.\\n\\nbelieve that traction is set to accelerate, positioning us ahead of \\n\\nthe curve as a company and as a country.  \\n\\nWe continue to invest in new products and services on M-PESA that \\n\\ninclude savings, wealth management and insurance.

At the time, no one thought \\n\\ntake place in the year ahead, among these the national 2022 \\n\\nit would be viable but today, I think it’s safe to say, M-PESA has \\n\\nelections. I am encouraged by the fact that, unlike other years, \\n\\nrevolutionised the financial services sector – particularly for low-\\n\\nincome people living in remote areas. M-PESA has opened new \\n\\navenues for people to interact with financial services, providing \\n\\naccess to affordable, convenient finance; enabling people to \\n\\nmake financial transactions remotely; removing the necessity for \\n\\ntravelling long distances to bank outlets and avoiding the risks of \\n\\ntransporting physical cash from one place to another. \\n\\n6\\n\\nthere appears to be no downturn in tourists and no sign of let \\n\\ndown in economic activity.

The following ‘True Earnings’ bridge highlights \\n\\nboth our resilience as a business and our strong fundamentals \\n\\nHOW WE ARRIVE AT THESE NUMBERS \\n\\nby showing that the total value we created for Kenyan society in \\n\\nKPMG first performed a True Earnings exercise for Safaricom \\n\\nFY22 was KSh 727 billion, 10.4 times greater than the financial \\n\\nin 2015 to identify our most material socioeconomic and \\n\\nprofit we made during the year. \\n\\nenvironmental impacts and to quantify these in financial terms. \\n\\nTRUE VALUE: IMPACT ON SOCIETY\\n\\nThe True Value assessment calculates that Safaricom \\n\\nsustained over 214 203 direct and indirect jobs during \\n\\nthe year and, if the wider (induced) effects on the \\n\\neconomy are included, this number increases to over  \\n\\nDuring that year, Step 1 of the True Value methodology was \\n\\nconducted to estimate our True Earnings.

As climate change is a fluctuating \\n\\nscenario, the social cost of carbon used for True Value \\n\\nrepresents a best practice for quantifying the impact of \\n\\nCO2. To illustrate a comparative year-on-year result, \\nthe  impact of carbon emissions has been adjusted \\n\\nfrom FY19-FY22 (see table \\'our True Value\\' on page \\n\\n30)\\n\\nWater: All businesses consume water, which in many \\n\\nregions is an essential, increasingly scarce resource \\n\\nand has a social and economic value that exceeds \\n\\nthe tariff paid for it. The True Value Methodology \\n\\nidentified the commercial consumption of water as \\n\\nhaving a negative societal impact and analysed water \\n\\nconsumption against the social cost of water, water \\n\\nscarcity and water stress, to quantify the value eroded \\n\\nthrough water consumption. The 2022 quantification \\n\\nof Safaricom’s water consumption has been updated \\n\\nto represent the social cost of water within Kenya \\n\\nbased on recent literature.\\n\\nWaste: Waste disposal has a negative cost to \\n\\nsociety. The quantification of this impact is based on \\n\\nthe social cost of handling one ton of waste within \\n\\na region. Although recycling allows for waste to be \\n\\nreused, there is still a negative cost to society related \\n\\nto the production of materials from recycled content. \\n\\nBy analysing the waste categories applicable within a \\n\\nbusiness, the KPMG True Earnings Bridge can quantify \\n\\nthe value eroded due to waste generation. The 2022 \\n\\nquantification of Safaricom’s waste consumption has \\n\\nbeen updated to represent the social cost of waste \\n\\nwithin Kenya based on more recent literature.\\n\\nDefinitions\\n\\nTrue Value: A three-step methodology \\nthat enables companies to (i) assess their \\n‘true’ earnings including externalities, (ii) \\nunderstand future earnings at risk and (iii) \\ndevelop business cases that create both \\ncorporate and societal value. \\n\\nTrue Earnings: The first step of the True \\nValue methodology, which quantifies and \\nmonetises a company’s material externalities.  \\n\\nTotal Economic Value: The nature and \\nmagnitude of the contribution Safaricom \\nmakes to the Kenyan economy. \\n\\nInduced economic impact: Our \\noperational and capital expenditure creates \\nadditional employment and benefits our \\nsuppliers’ employees.   A proportion of the \\nadditional income generated in this way \\nis spent on the consumption of goods and \\nservices.  Through linkages and multiplier \\neffects, this positively impacts the broader \\neconomy by stimulating additional demand \\nfor the products and services produced within \\nthe economy.\\n\\nIndirect economic impact: Proposed \\nadditional direct expenditure also adds \\nmore widely to economic activity in general \\nthrough the additional inputs purchased from \\nsuppliers. The businesses impacted along the \\nsupply chain would then need to increase \\ntheir production and employment, thereby \\nalso generating increased economic activity \\nand employment and in turn stimulating \\nadditional demand for goods and services \\nalong their own supply chains and so on.\\n\\n29\\n\\nPARTNERING FOR GROWTH: TRANSFORMING LIVES   |   KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS\\x0cEarnings\\n\\nEconomic Value-Add\\n\\nTRUE VALUE: IMPACT ON SOCIETY\\n\\nThe True Value assessment calculates that Safaricom \\n\\nsustained over 214 203 direct and indirect jobs during \\n\\nthe year and, if the wider (induced) effects on the \\n\\neconomy are included, this number increases to over  \\n\\n1 135 588.\\n\\nProfit\\n\\nKSh 69.6b\\n\\n\\x811.4%\\n\\n298 078\\n\\n(230 582)\\n\\n69 648\\n\\nEconomic value added through \\noperations\\n\\nKSh 393b\\n\\n\\x818%\\n\\n393 823\\n\\n13 168\\n\\n(32 770)\\n\\no fit\\n\\nr\\n\\ns   p\\n\\n0 . 4  ti m e\\n\\nd :  1\\n\\na t e\\n\\ne\\n\\nr\\n\\ne   c\\n\\na l u\\n\\ne   V\\n\\nu\\n\\nr\\n\\nT\\n\\nAll figures on the graph \\nin KSh millions\\n\\nREVENUE\\n\\nCOST\\n\\nPROFIT\\n\\nECONOMIC \\nVALUE ADDED \\nOPERATIONS\\n\\nECONOMIC \\nVALUE ADDED \\nCAPEX\\n\\nCORRUPTION\\n\\n30\\n\\n|   SAFARICOM SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS REPORT 2022KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS\\x0cSocial externalities\\n\\nEnvironmental externalities\\n\\n275 837\\n\\n5 728\\n\\n2 959\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n(1 074)\\n\\n(94)\\n\\n(14)\\n\\n\\'True\\' \\nValue\\n\\n727 187\\n\\no fit\\n\\nr\\n\\ns   p\\n\\n0 . 4  ti m e\\n\\nd :  1\\n\\na t e\\n\\ne\\n\\nr\\n\\ne   c\\n\\na l u\\n\\ne   V\\n\\nu\\n\\nr\\n\\nT\\n\\nSocial value of M-PESA\\n\\nKSh 275b\\n\\n\\x8114%\\n\\nEnvironmental externalities\\n\\nKSh 1.19b\\n\\n\\x8125%\\n\\nM-PESA \\nSOCIAL \\nVALUE\\n\\nSOCIAL \\nVALUE OF \\nJOBS\\n\\nSTRATEGIC \\nSOCIAL \\nINVESTMENTS\\n\\nHEALTH & \\nSAFETY\\n\\nWATER\\n\\nC02 & \\nENERGY\\n\\nRECYCLING\\n\\nWASTE\\n\\nTRUE VALUE\\n\\n31\\n\\nPARTNERING FOR GROWTH: TRANSFORMING LIVES   |   KPI SUMMARYOUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR MATERIAL TOPICSOUR BUSINESS\\x0cTRUE EARNINGS  \\n(FY19-FY22)\\n\\n2\\n0\\n6\\n\\n7\\n1\\n3\\n\\n1\\n0\\n5\\n\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n\\n0\\n3\\n5\\n\\n8\\n3\\n3\\n\\n9\\n4\\n4\\n\\n1\\n4\\n2\\n\\n0\\n8\\n5\\n4\\n4\\n3\\n\\n7\\n9\\n0\\n1\\n5\\n2\\n\\n0\\n2\\n2\\n4\\n7\\n3\\n\\n7\\n1\\n5\\n\\n4\\n8\\n2\\n\\n1\\n9\\n4\\n\\n2\\n6\\n\\n8\\n9\\n6\\n\\n4\\n7\\n\\n6\\n7\\n6\\n\\n8\\n6\\n\\n9\\n4\\n6\\n\\n9\\n6\\n\\n)\\n5\\n6\\n8\\n(\\n\\n)\\n8\\n2\\n8\\n(\\n\\n)\\n8\\n4\\n9\\n(\\n\\n)\\n9\\n8\\n1\\n\\n1\\n(\\n\\nFY19\\n\\nFY20\\n\\nFY21\\n\\nFY22\\n\\nFinancial (Profit)\\n\\nEconomic\\n\\nSocial\\n\\nEnvironmental\\n\\nOUR ENVIRONMENTAL VALUE-ADD\\n\\nThe overall negative environmental impact on Safaricom’s ‘True \\n\\nEarning’s increased by 25% from FY21. The largest contributor \\n\\nto value erosion was due to carbon emissions. This was due to \\n\\ninfrastructure expansion and increased Scope 3 emissions as \\n\\nCOVID-19 lockdown restrictions were lifted and business travel \\n\\nresumed. To align with best practice, the KPMG True Value \\n\\nAssessment also updated the social cost of carbon to reflect the \\n\\nlatest climate change statistics.\\n\\nDuring FY22, we increased the scope of reporting to the regions \\n\\nwhere our regional offices, retail shops and Mobile Switching \\n\\nRooms (MSRs) are located. The KPMG True Value assessment \\n\\nfurther updated financial proxies to align to more a current \\n\\nrepresentations of impact assessments related to water in Kenya.\\n\\nIn FY22, we recycled 88.1% of the solid waste collected from \\n\\nour own operations, including paper, organic and plastics. Of \\n\\nthis amount, 11.9% could not be recycled as it included items \\n\\nlike diapers and face masks which pose threats to health. KPMG \\n\\nupdated the quantification of waste based on best practice. Waste \\n\\nquantifications were based on the social cost of handling one ton \\n\\nof waste within a region. Although recycling allows for waste to \\n\\nbe reused, there is still a negative cost to society related to the \\n\\nproduction of materials from recycled content. \\n\\nThis chart demonstrates how all factors have contributed towards \\n\\nOUR IMPACT ON SOCIETY\\n\\nSafaricom’s ‘True Earnings’ for this period. Most noteworthy was \\n\\nthe growing contribution from social externalities, particularly \\n\\nthrough the social value created by M-PESA which grew and \\n\\nRegrettably, there were two recorded third-party fatalities in FY22. \\n\\nOur thoughts and condolences go out to the grieving family and \\n\\nfriends of the deceased. We had five fewer lost-time injuries as \\n\\nevolved. Throughout the period, the greatest contribution to \\n\\ncompared to last year. \\n\\n‘True Earnings’ came from the economic value created through \\n\\nSafaricom’s operations and capital projects, whereas the negative \\n\\nenvironmental externalities, though recognised as a material topic, \\n\\ncontinue to have minimal impact. \\n\\nThe economic impact made through our operations is the greatest \\n\\ncontributor to the value we create and has increased by 8.60% \\n\\nsince FY21. The value created through operational expenditure \\n\\nincreased by 9% in the year under review, with the value created \\n\\nby capital expenditure increasing by 13%. This was anticipated as \\n\\nthe overall capital expenditure for FY22 increased by 13%.\\n\\nM-PESA continued to create value for society with a 14% increase \\n\\nin societal value Y-o-Y. The KSh 275 billion worth of societal value \\n\\ncreated by M-PESA stems from our constant efforts to increase the \\n\\npositive impacts to society of the offering and provide relevant \\n\\nsolutions to our customers. The social value of M-PESA remains \\n\\na significant creator of value for Kenyan society, increasing by \\n\\n14% in FY22. The major drivers of this growth were the increase \\n\\nin the numbers of customers and agents, a significant increase in \\n\\nthe number of merchants, the increase in the average number of \\n\\ntransactions per customer, as well as the increase in the average \\n\\nvalue of transactions made per customer.

Our main \\n\\nregulator remains the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA). In total we \\n\\nengage with ten regulatory bodies (see page 79 of this report) in a constantly \\n\\nshifting ecosystem as we expand our products and services to prepare for 5G, \\n\\nartificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Within this context, we \\n\\nare constantly looking for ways to strengthen our engagement with regulators to \\n\\nensure the highest standards of transparency and protection of consumer rights. \\n\\nThe Regulatory and Public Policy (RPP) team is a department within the Corporate \\n\\nAffairs division, comprising six streams: public policy and market, technical \\n\\nregulation and infrastructure business, government relations, competition, \\n\\nregulatory compliance and interconnect, together with international business.\\n\\nIn the past year there were several key developments in the regulatory space. \\n\\nHowever, through proactive engagement, we maintained our mutually respectful, \\n\\ncordial relationship with regulators as we collaborated to connect people and \\n\\nfacilitate online learning, remote work, e-commerce and financial services. We \\n\\ncontinued to file our quarterly compliance returns with the Communications \\n\\nAuthority (CA). Our aim, in engaging with regulators on draft regulations, \\n\\nguidelines, and bills, is to ensure a positive outlook and favourable consideration \\n\\nof our products and services. \\n\\nRefer to the accompanying appendix for a view of some of our key sustainability \\n\\nreporting standards implemented to guide business and ecosystem operations \\n\\nin support of our strategy - \"Accelerating new growth areas delivering superior \\n\\ncustomer experience in order to be a purpose led technology company by 2025”.\\n\\nCOOPERATING WITH REGULATORS\\n\\nIn a positive development, we were allocated 60MHz of spectrum in the \\n\\n2600MHz band by the CA, which will be used for 5G. This heralds a new era \\n\\nfor Safaricom as we prepare to roll out this technology for various use cases that \\n\\nwill benefit our customers.\\n\\nIncreasing access \\nto information and \\ncommunications technology \\n(SDG9) while ensuring \\nsustainable consumption \\nand production patterns both \\nwithin our own organisation \\nand amongst our stakeholders \\n(SDG12), are key factors \\nin transforming lives.

Consequently, the National Environment \\n\\nManagement Authority (NEMA) solicited comments from the \\n\\nKenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) on our proposed 5G \\n\\nprojects. This negatively impacted the timelines for acquisition \\n\\nof the 5G rollout licence. We continue to work closely with the \\n\\nKCAA to ensure that necessary awareness is created on 5G.\\n\\nIn a move to accelerate the fight against identity theft and \\n\\nimprove data accuracy, in September 2021 the CA directed the \\n\\ncountry’s mobile operators to ensure that the personal details of \\n\\ntheir subscribers were fully updated in compliance with prevailing \\n\\nlaws by 15 April 2022. The directive also provided for the \\n\\ndeactivation of any SIM cards that continued to be non-compliant \\n\\nafter the deadline. Registration had to be done in person at the \\n\\nrespective mobile operators’ retail outlets. However, faced with \\n\\nlong queues at outlets, mobile operators lobbied the CA to allow \\n\\nonline registration and to extend the deadline by six months. The \\n\\nCA granted both requests.

The roll out of 5G proved \\n\\nto be more challenging and complex than expected, necessitating a \\n\\nhigh level of financial investment, and involving diverse stakeholders \\n\\nincluding government, regulatory authorities, network vendors and device \\n\\nmanufacturers. While the initiative was hampered by the significant lack \\n\\nof 5G devices, we continue to anticipate growing adoption by customers \\n\\nacross all fields.\\n\\nOur key focus in FY22 was improving customer data and network \\n\\nexperiences by increasing radio capacity and network coverage. This \\n\\nwas achieved by capacity expansion, particularly in the radio network, \\n\\nas well as connecting sites to fibre especially in the rural areas. We \\n\\nupgraded a total of 1 100 and 1 000 4G and 3G sites respectively and \\n\\nrolled out 495 new sites. In addition, we integrated new 4G spectrum \\n\\ninto 1 800 sites.

In \\naddition, forest products can provide \\nsafety nets to local communities \\nwhen climate change causes crop \\nfailures. In terms of mitigation, tree \\ngrowing reduces the harmful effects of \\ngreenhouse gas emissions by creating \\ncarbon sinks and helps to offset the \\nCO2 emissions from Safaricom’s \\noperations.\\n\\nIn partnership with local communities \\nand the KFS, we planted 372 000 trees \\nin FY22, bringing the total number of \\ntrees planted to date to just over one \\nmillion. We are behind in our planting \\ntarget largely due to the destruction of \\nyoung trees by wildfires and livestock \\nas most of the forests are not fenced. \\n\\nWe are now working with the KFS and \\nCFAs to educate and sensitise local \\ncommunities, thereby mitigating these \\nchallenges. \\n\\nNUMBER OF TREES PLANTED OVER THREE \\nYEARS (CUMULATIVE)\\n\\nTrees planted\\n\\n144 000\\n\\n650 000\\n\\n1 022 000\\n\\nFY20\\n\\nFY21\\n\\nFY22\\n\\nWe are cognisant of the far-reaching \\neffects of human activities on climate \\nchange and the need to plant trees to \\noffset our CO2 emissions.

Safaricom is \\ncollaborating with 4R Digital to test a \\nnew way of overcoming the challenge. \\n4R Digital’s Carbon Value Exchange \\n(CaVEx) is an innovative digital platform \\nthat enables carbon offsetting and \\nsequestration activities from a wide \\nrange of micro-small projects in the \\nglobal South to be digitised, tracked \\nand sold in voluntary carbon markets. \\n\\nUsing technology advances in remote \\nsensing, device connectivity and digital \\npayments, the platform will increase \\ndiversity of choice for carbon buyers \\nand enable micro-small projects to be \\nrewarded for undertaking clean activity \\nin a digital, and highly transparent \\nmanner. \\n\\nTo participate in CaVEx, carbon \\nreduction/removal forestry projects \\nmust follow strict data protocols specific \\nto their use case, approved by an \\nexternal auditor. Only when protocol \\nrequirements are fulfilled, and data is \\nflowing from remotely sensed devices \\ninto the CaVEx platform, can the \\nproject start generating carbon credits. \\nThe carbon credits created follow all \\nrelevant ISO standards (14060-series) \\nand AI-enhanced data screening ensure \\nvalidity.

We also reinstated payment cycles twice a month, one \\n\\nat mid-month, one at the near end of the month, to enhance timely \\n\\nsettlement. In addition, purchase order (PO) suppliers can now \\n\\ninvoice online, which has accelerated the payment process. We have \\n\\ncontinued accelerating the digital agenda to create efficiencies in all \\n\\nour operations to the extent that we now have over 90% touchless \\n\\nPOs.

We also looked at the \\n\\nimplementation of the Data Protection Act, which prohibits transfer \\n\\nof personal data to third parties unless the data subject has given \\n\\nprior consent.  \\n\\nTo support our suppliers further, we continued to collaborate with \\n\\nfinancial institutions in Kenya including ABSA Bank Kenya (ABSA), \\n\\nCitibank Kenya, and Equity Bank and most recently with Kenya \\n\\nCommercial Bank (KCB) as regards local purchase order (LPO) \\n\\nfinancing and invoice discounting to provide financial backing. \\n\\nSUPPLIER SPEND BY CATEGORY\\n(KSh million)\\n\\n9\\n1\\n5\\n6\\n5\\n\\n1\\n1\\n3\\n\\n8\\n2\\n\\n0\\n7\\n4\\n\\n4\\n6\\n\\n6\\n2\\n2\\n\\n2\\n2\\n\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n6\\n5\\n\\n3\\n7\\n1\\n6\\n3\\n\\n8\\n0\\n4\\n8\\n5\\n\\n9\\n8\\n2\\n6\\n3\\n\\nThis will broaden financial access to women, youth and PwDs, as \\n\\nFY19\\n\\nFY20\\n\\nFY21\\n\\nFY22\\n\\nwe continue signing Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with \\n\\nother several financial institutions.\\n\\nTo facilitate continuous improvement, we commissioned a \\n\\nsurvey in February 2022 which gives us a Net Promoter Score \\n\\n(NPS) indicating supplier levels of satisfaction and confidence \\n\\nin Safaricom.

Investors can see management initiatives to enhance \\n\\nfinancial inclusion as we now explore the next growth phases \\n\\ngoing forward and evolve M-PESA into a broader digital \\n\\nreviewing. We have also engaged extensively with this group of \\n\\ninvestors regarding the Environmental, Social and Governance \\n\\nDisclosures Guidance Manual published towards the end of \\n\\n2021 by the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). The manual \\n\\nprovides a granular, tactical approach to ESG reporting that meets \\n\\ninternational standards on ESG reporting, ranging from expectations \\n\\nrelated to the responsibilities of the Board, Chief Executive Officer \\n\\nand sustainability managers, to guidelines related to stakeholder \\n\\nengagement, the principles of materiality and the incorporation of \\n\\nkey performance indicators into reporting processes.\\n\\nFUTURE FOCUS\\n\\nplatform, offering universal payment network and integrated \\n\\n•  Give more visibility to investors on our Ethiopian \\n\\nbusiness solutions.

the public perception of quality rental housing by embrace technology high density rental housing be vital component of the urban infrastructure ecosystem in the majority of african city at least percent of urban dweller be unable to afford home ownership due to the gap between income level and cost of ownership in kenya for example percent of nairobis work resident earn less than kes us per month and spend percent kes us on rent if one be to spend the same amount on mortgage one could only afford to borrow up to kes us an insufficient amount to buy home globally rental housing have be use by virtually every household at some stage in their lifetime and therefore should be consider an important element in the housing market although rental household have typically be associate with fill the need of young people leave home to study or start family the more generally observe trend elsewhere be that renting be now fill sizeable need at all stage of life young generation be increasingly less inclined to buy home and instead choose to place their saving elsewhere for many it have become preferred way of living however in many develop market the head of household who be commonly tenant fall within the low income bracket and the standard of rental housing be sub standard this be mainly due to the lack of policy focus on rental housing in the develop market where the link between price and quality may not be proportional hence create perception that affordable rental living be greatly challenging proposition acorn be work to change that perception since we know

urban planning in term of spatial development and master plan and lack of infrastructure and serviced land near commuter node densification of city form central part of the solution to these challenge without densification and efficiency in planning land cost can represent up to percent of project cost in the end make it unaffordable to the very market segment that be in need densification basically refer to the concept of build tall building within central node where infrastructure be available result in reduce cost per square meter of liveable area all of acorns student property to

emission at about percent of total emission and with potential rapid increase due to urbanisation underscore the importance of encourage the development of low carbon building with global temperature expect to increase by at least degree by green investment be gain traction as plausible counter to extreme weather condition as result of global greenhouse gas emission the mandating of new building

the public perception of quality rental housing by embrace technology high density rental housing be vital component of the urban infrastructure ecosystem in the majority of african city at least percent of urban dweller be unable to afford home ownership due to the gap between income level and cost of ownership in kenya for example percent of nairobis work resident earn less than kes us per month and spend percent kes us on rent if one be to spend the same amount on mortgage one could only afford to borrow up to kes us an insufficient amount to buy home globally rental housing have be use by virtually every household at some stage in their lifetime and therefore should be consider an important element in the housing market although rental household have typically be associate with fill the need of young people leave home to study or start family the more generally observe trend elsewhere be that renting be now fill sizeable need at all stage of life young generation be increasingly less inclined to buy home and instead choose to place their saving elsewhere for many it have become preferred way of living however in many develop market the head of household who be commonly tenant fall within the low income bracket and the standard of rental housing be sub standard this be mainly due to the lack of policy focus on rental housing in the develop market where the link between price and quality may not be proportional hence create perception that affordable rental living be greatly challenging proposition acorn be work to change that perception since we know

attainment of provision of affordable housing in africa there be currently many bottleneck for the achievement of affordable housing on the african continent include lack of proper well coordinate urban planning in term of spatial development and master plan and lack of infrastructure and serviced land near commuter node densification of city form central part of the solution to these challenge without densification and efficiency in planning land cost can represent up to percent of project cost in the end make it unaffordable to the very market segment that be in need densification basically refer to the concept of build tall building within central node where infrastructure be available result in reduce cost per square meter of liveable area all of acorns student property to

percent of urban dweller be unable to afford home ownership due to the gap between income level and cost of ownership in kenya for example percent of nairobis work resident earn less than kes us per month and spend percent kes us on rent if one be to spend the same amount on mortgage one could only afford to borrow up to kes us an insufficient amount to buy home globally rental housing have be use by virtually every household at some stage in their lifetime and therefore should be consider an important element in the housing market although rental household have typically be associate with fill the need of young people leave home to study or start family the more generally observe trend elsewhere be that renting be now fill sizeable need at all stage of life young generation be increasingly less inclined to buy home and instead choose to place their saving elsewhere for many it have become preferred way of living however in many develop market the head of household who be commonly tenant fall within the low income bracket and the standard of rental housing be sub standard this be mainly due to the lack of policy focus on rental housing in the develop market where the link between price and quality may not be proportional hence create perception that affordable rental living be greatly challenging proposition acorn be work to change that perception since we know that affordable rental housing need not be rarity but can rather also be synonymous with quality our customer satisfaction score help we keep track of the experience and perception of our customer our long term success depend on the efficient management and maintenance of the property which will impact the positive experience feel by resident sustainability how we create value corrective action the

urban planning in term of spatial development and master plan and lack of infrastructure and serviced land near commuter node densification of city form central part of the solution to these challenge without densification and efficiency in planning land cost can represent up to percent of project cost in the end make it unaffordable to the very market segment that be in need densification basically refer to the concept of build tall building within central node where infrastructure be available result in reduce cost per square meter of liveable area all of acorns student property to date have be successfully build under this concept and thus affordability have be achieve green resource efficient and climate resilient building globally building be significant contributor to carbon emission at about percent of total emission and with potential rapid increase due to urbanisation underscore the importance of encourage the development of low carbon building with global temperature expect to increase by at least degree by green investment be gain traction as plausible counter to extreme weather condition as result of global greenhouse gas emission the mandating of new building
